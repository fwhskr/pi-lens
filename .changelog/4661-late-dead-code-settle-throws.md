- **A dead-code scan that finishes late no longer crashes pi-lens or stalls on a disk error (closes #4661).** When a Python dead-code scan outlived the turn_end budget and the disk then refused its baseline write (full, read-only, or the cache path taken by a file), the error escaped as an unhandled rejection and the scan stayed parked, so every later turn reported it as in flight and never started another. A failed baseline write is counted as `dead-code-baseline-write-failed` and the scan's findings are still delivered on the next turn.
