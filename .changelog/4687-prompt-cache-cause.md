- **Name the prompt-cache misses pi-lens causes, and stop losing real expiry to a long tool result.** `cache_usage` now reports `tool-set-changed` and `system-prompt-changed` from the unbounded ordered system-message set, measures a miss against the last healthy read, names a turn whose whole prompt shrank `prefix-shrunk` and re-baselines on it on every provider, whether or not it reports cache writes (so a compaction or a model switch stops reading as a miss, and a second rewrite on Gemini, Mistral or OpenAI still does), reads `ttl-expired` across an ordinary 20,000-character message, reads `partial-eviction` on Anthropic and Bedrock, where the re-sent tokens are cache writes, and records one `prompt-cache-miss-unexplained` degradation row on a session's second unexplained miss — the first stays silent and later misses only raise the count (#4687).
