- **Open documents resync after `git stash`, `git checkout .` or `git restore`.** A bash command that discards working-tree changes without moving HEAD now resyncs the files it reverted before the tool result returns, so diagnostics no longer describe the discarded edits (#4502). A code-mod or HEAD move over many files now resyncs exactly the files it changed instead of every open document, and a failed resync is reported as a failure instead of a clean zero (slice 2 of #4535).
